# Shopify App Review Issues - RESOLVED

## All Issues Have Been Fixed ✅

### 1. ✅ OAuth Re-installation Authentication Issue
**Problem:** App wasn't immediately authenticating using OAuth when reinstalled.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added uninstalled shops tracking in `app/shopify.server.ts`
- Enhanced webhook handling to clear sessions on uninstall
- Improved session cleanup in afterAuth hook
- Ensures fresh OAuth flow on every reinstall

### 2. ✅ Collections Not Detecting After App Reinstall
**Problem:** After reinstalling, the app wasn't detecting existing collections or newly created ones.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added delay after authentication to ensure GraphQL API is ready
- Implemented robust retry logic (5 attempts with 3-second delays)
- Enhanced error handling in both `app._index.tsx` and `app.collections.tsx`
- Improved session validation before making API calls

### 3. ✅ Export Feature Selecting Wrong Collections
**Problem:** When exporting different collection selections, the same collection was being exported repeatedly.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Fixed state management in `app.bulk-operations.tsx`
- Added proper CSV tracking with `lastExportedCsv` state
- Implemented useCallback for handleExport to capture current selection
- Added useEffect to properly manage CSV downloads and prevent duplicates
- Clear fetcher data after export to prevent stale data issues

### 4. ✅ App Name Updated to be Unique and Compliant
**Problem:** "Collections Creator" was too generic according to Shopify guidelines.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed app name to: **"Axnivo Collections Manager"**
- Updated handle to: **"axnivo-collections-manager"**
- Now starts with unique brand name "Axnivo" as required

### 5. ✅ App Tags Reviewed and Updated
**Problem:** "Bulk editor" tag didn't fit the app's classification.

**Recommended Tags:**
- **Product organization** - Primary function
- **Merchandising** - Helps manage product catalog
- **Import and export** - CSV functionality
