## ðŸ“… When Do Merchants Pay?

**Merchants are charged IMMEDIATELY upon subscription approval.**
- The payment is processed on the same day they install and approve the app subscription
- NOT after 30 days - payment happens right away
- Their credit card is billed immediately for the first month/year

## ðŸ’° When Do Developers Receive Payment?

After a merchant pays, the funds appear in your **Shopify Partner Dashboard â†’ Payouts** within **3-7 days** (next weekly payout cycle).

- Shopify pays app developers **once per week**
- Usually on **Monday or Tuesday** depending on your region
- Check your Partner Dashboard â†’ Payouts for payment status

3. **Shopify batches all your app earnings** and sends them weekly
4. **Check Partner Dashboard â†’ Payouts** for payment status and history

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- Plan your cash flow around weekly payouts, not daily
- Remember there's a 3-7 day delay between merchant payment and your payout
- All amounts are subject to Shopify's revenue share (typically 20% for apps under $1M annual revenue)
- Payouts include ALL your app earnings for that week, not individual transactions
